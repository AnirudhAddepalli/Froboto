# Release Notes v 1.0 Spraying System

Wyatt requested a different UI layout.
See his power point slide.

## Adding new library FFMPEG for video file creation

Copy the directory FFMpeg 
from: source/external/FFmpeg
to: c:/FFmpeg

## Issues: Video file saving

Video saving is always to file:
c:/temp/video.MP4

Copy this file from there to whereever you want.

This file is saving 20 frames per second.
That is not correct. I am finetuning this.

We should have about 50 frames per second.
That will depend on the machine.

## We need to talk about "Spray and Plunge"

I did not take into account "Blot"
Not sure where we need to add that.

## Variables

Date - should this be filled out by the app?
Spray_time - this should also be filled out automatically?

This variables are saved in the Robot's computer.
But we cannot save there if they are no defined there.

## TODO: Grid related info

I am not clear about the goal with it.
We should discuss this part.

## End
