Wyatt List 2022-11-17

The app will use the "prep_delay" value defined in the JSON config file.
This value is added to the plunge value and sent to the RPI unit.

When the users presses on LOG FILE save, the extension of the file will be TXT.

The app now supports 1 through 8 grid positions.

The Grid position selector will count from 1 to 8 and roll over from 8 back to 1.
The same rollover happens when the user goes down to 1, it rolls over to 8.
